fake-news Fake-News-Buster-
A machine learning-based web application that classifies news articles as Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing techniques.

📌 Project Description
This project aims to identify whether a news article is fake or real by analyzing its textual content. With the rise in misinformation across digital platforms, such a system can help mitigate the spread of fake news by providing a quick credibility check using machine learning.

The project includes:

Text preprocessing and vectorization (TF-IDF)
Model training using Logistic Regression
Evaluation and accuracy measurement
Deployment using Flask for a user-friendly interface
🚀 Features
Clean and simple UI using HTML/CSS
Real-time news classification
Trained on reliable dataset from Kaggle
Lightweight Flask backend
🧠 Algorithms Used
TF-IDF Vectorizer for text feature extraction
Logistic Regression for binary classification
Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall
